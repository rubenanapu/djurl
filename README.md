Simple yet helpful library for writing Django urls by an easy, short and intuitive way.

Why should I use DjUrl?
---
Django routing urls aren't easy to deal with, regular expressions can become a nightmare sometimes. Just imagine dealing with such routes in your `django app`:
```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from core import BlogView, SinglePostView, SearchResultsView, ArchiveView

urlpatterns = [
	# => /blog/
	url(r'^blog/$', BlogView.as_view(), name="blog"),
	# => /blog/5
	url(r'^blog/(?P<post_id>[0-9]+)/$', SinglePostView.as_view(), name="singlepost"),
	# => /blog/search/sometitle
	url(r'^blog/search/(?P<search_query>[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/$', SearchResultsView.as_view(), name="search"),
	# => /blog/archive/2017/02/12
	url(r'^blog/archive/(?P<date>[0-9]{4}-(0?([1-9])|10|11|12)-((0|1|2)?([1-9])|[1-3]0|31))/$',
		ArchiveView.as_view(), name="archive")
]
```
That's too much work and you lost me in those regex. With **DjUrl** this comes easy, you just need to *express what you want*, **DjUrl will handle the regular expressions for you**:

```python
from djurl import url
from core import BlogView, SinglePostView, SearchResultsView, ArchiveView

urlpatterns = [
	url('/blog', BlogView, name="blog"),
	url('/blog/:id', SinglePostView, name="singlepost"),
	url('/blog/search/:query', SearchResultsView, name="search"),
	url('/blog/archive/:date', ArchiveView, name="archive")
]
```
No regex, just clean paths and param names. You can now pass the regex work to DjUrl and concentrate in the *bussiness logic*. It saves you a lot of time and code. *You don't need to worry about the routes anymore*. **Note you don't need to call `as_view` in your CBV's.** DjUrl does this for you as well.

Usage
---
Now you know what you should use `DjUrl`, It's time to learn how to use it. DjUrl has a list of known/default pattern that you can use in your routes, these are:

* `id`: A secuence of characters from 0 to 9. Ej: `1, 12, 454545, 8885500, 8`
* `pk`: A primary key, it's like `id` but needed for `Class Based Views`.
* `page`: falls in the same category, but you'd use `page` for a better param name.
* `slug`: A simple string (alphanumeric characters).
* `query`: A search parameter. It allows some special characters that *slug* doesn't. Ex: `hello%20word`, `don%27t_quote-me`
* `day`: A number between 01,..., 31.
* `month`: A number between 01,...,12.
* `year`: A four digits number: `1998, 2017, 2018, 3015, 2020, 1406...`
* `date`: An expression with `year-month-day` format: `2017-06-23, 1998-10-20, 1492-10-12`
* `filename`: An expression with `*.\w{2,4}` format: `index.js`, `detail.html`, `'my_book.pdf'`, `'dfj358h-g9854-fn84n4.tmp'`
* `UUID`: *Universally unique identifier* is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. Use a format as `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Ex: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`

That means, wherever you put `/:id` you can use it in your view as param (named `id`).
```python
url('post/:pk/comment/:id', myview, name="post_comment")
```
Your view:
```python
def myview(request, pk, id):
	# Use `pk` (post's) and `id` (comment's)
```

But what if I have two or more id's, or two slugs? What if I wanted to use a custom name for my id's? - Ok, you can use custom names if you end it with `_` + the pattern type. - What?...
```python
url('post/:post_pk/comment/:comment_id', myview, ...)
# ...
def myview(request, post_pk, comment_id):
	# `post_pk` is parsed as a :pk and `comment_id` like an :id

```
Yeah, it sounds good!, but... What if I wanted to use my own patterns? - Easy, any world in the path is of type `:slug` by default, but if you need a custom pattern you can register many as you want:
```python
from djurl import url, register_pattern
register_pattern('hash', '[a-f0-9]{9}')
# parsed as slug
url('/:user', myUserView),
# custom pattern
url('/:hash', myview),
```
